## 🧠 AI Engineering Projects

### 🔹 [Modular RAG: Feedback-Informed Evaluation and Continual Learning](https://github.com/r3hmi/Mod-rag-app)
**Stack:** Python · FastAPI · Streamlit · Hugging Face Transformers · FAISS · Continual Learning Modules · Hugging Face Spaces  
A modular architecture for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) featuring feedback-driven evaluation and continual learning.



### 🔹 [Deployable Claude Agents – Using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://github.com/r3hmi/claude-bedrock-agentcore)
**Stack:** Amazon Bedrock · Claude · AgentCore SDK  
Builds production-ready Claude agents with integrated tool capabilities using Amazon Bedrock’s AgentCore SDK.



### 🔹 [BERT vs. DistilBERT for QA – A/B Testing Performance Evaluation](https://github.com/r3hmi/bert-distilbert-ab-testing)
**Stack:** Python · Hugging Face Transformers · Streamlit  
A head-to-head A/B test comparing BERT and DistilBERT across latency, accuracy, and cost-efficiency metrics.

## MLOps Projects

### 🔹 [Industrial IoT Predictive Maintenance (End-to-End MLOps Pipeline)](https://github.com/r3hmi/graph-mlops-neo4j-eta)

** Stack: ** PySpark · MLflow (Tracking & Registry) · FastAPI · Docker · Kubernetes (Helm) · Prometheus/Grafana · Evidently.ai · DVC · Neo4j

Predicts equipment failures in industrial IoT systems before they occur, reducing costly downtime. Implements a fully containerized MLOps workflow — from Spark-based feature engineering and MLflow-tracked model training to FastAPI-based serving on Kubernetes. Includes CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions), real-time drift detection (Prometheus + Evidently), and lineage tracking in Neo4j for full auditability and compliance.

### 🔹 [RecomPulse: E-Commerce Personalization Engine (End-to-End MLOps)](https://github.com/r3hmi/graph-mlops-neo4j-eta)

**Stack:** Kafka/Kinesis · PySpark · Feature Store (Feast/Redis) · Neo4j · MLflow (Tracking & Registry) · FastAPI · Docker · Kubernetes (Helm) · Prometheus/Grafana · DVC

Streams clicks, carts, and purchases into a lakehouse to train a hybrid recommender (ALS + content + graph features). Ships a low-latency FastAPI microservice with ANN retrieval → model re-rank, auto-scaled on Kubernetes. CI/CD handles canary rollouts; Prometheus/Grafana watch CTR, conversion, drift, and fairness, with MLflow-driven retraining to keep recs fresh and relevant.

### 🔹 [DelaySense: Responsible AI for Delivery Risk (Explainable Tabular ML)](https://github.com/r3hmi/graph-mlops-neo4j-eta)

**Stack:** XGBoost/RandomForest · SHAP · LIME · Probability Calibration · Streamlit · MLflow · DVC

Predicts shipment delays with calibrated probabilities and human-friendly explanations. Ships an interactive Streamlit app for real-time scoring and what-if analysis (sliders, counterfactuals), plus global & local explainability (SHAP/LIME) so logistics teams can see why a delivery is flagged and how to reduce risk.

### 🔹 [Graph‑MLOps on SageMaker: ETA Prediction with Neo4j & LLMs](https://github.com/r3hmi/graph-mlops-neo4j-eta)

**Stack:** AWS SageMaker · Neo4j · Graph ML · LLMs  
Combines Amazon SageMaker with Neo4j to model last-mile delivery routes using graph-based ML and LLM-embedded features for enhanced ETA prediction. Utalising LaDe (Industry-grade Delivery Dataset); Covers ~10.677 million packages delivered by ~21,000 couriers over 6 months in real operations across multiple cities.

## 📊 Analytical Projects

### 🔹 [TSP Optimizer as a Service – Streamlit Dashboard for Dynamic Routing](https://github.com/r3hmi/tsp-optimizer-streamlit)

**Stack:** Python · Metaheuristics · Streamlit · Dynamic Routing  
Solves the Traveling Salesperson Problem using metaheuristic algorithms and delivers real-time routing optimization via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
